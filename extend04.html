                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify the online color converter you used to complete this assignment. Include an absolute link to your resource and include the target attribute to open the page in a new tab. -->

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p> Hexadecimal (HEX), RGB, and HSL color codes are used to represent colors in web development. HEX employs six characters to represent red, green, and blue intensities. RGB specifies colors using numeric values (0-255) for red, green, and blue channels.
                    HSL utilizes hue, saturation, and lightness parameters, represented as an angle and percentages, respectively. HEX is compact and widely used, RGB offers precise control over color channels, and HSL provides an intuitive approach to color selection. 
                    Each system has its advantages, with HEX being common in web design, RGB prevalent in graphics software, and HSL gaining popularity for its ease of use.</p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p>My preferred color code format is hexadecimal (HEX). Hexadecimal values are easy to understand and work with, as they represent colors using a combination of six characters (letters A-F and numbers 0-9) arranged in pairs to represent the intensity of 
                    red, green, and blue components. For example, #FF0000 represents pure red, #00FF00 represents pure green, and #0000FF represents pure blue.</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p>HWB color, standing for Hue, Whiteness, and Blackness, is an alternative color model to HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and RGB (Red, Green, Blue) in CSS. 
                    It defines colors based on three components Hue, Whiteness, and Blacknes.</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p>CMYK color is a color model used in printing, standing for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (Black). 
                    Unlike RGB, which is used for digital displays, CMYK is primarily used in print production.</p>
